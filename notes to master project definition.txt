Master project definition

"A BEING", in danish "et væsen"

- copy learning goals,
- Collect ideas and make realistic choices. 
	- only state 3 will be acheived in AI4. 
		-Right now I work double time on it, and get nowhere. I have enourmous amounts of overhead and daemons running.

- Update motivation, to be more realistic
	- What is the purpose of this project, the researh goal?
		- Development of a living mood lamp. 
			- Design choices based on this goal.
			- Mood lamps are great at affecting a room. 		
		- Learning, but also exploration of Human Robot Interaction
		- Machine learning techinques, experience with representation learning, combinatorial learning, continuous learning, semi-supervised. 
	- 










- Distinquish main pillars
	-Appearance
		- Soft simple and elegant exterior. 
		- Clean. Not a robot, its a being.
		- Very stretchy fabric, so it will stay tight durin morphing.
		- Body made out of spring. Permenently female, or male of this is the model one chooses. 
		- 3D print spring body, like circle zigZag spring at Tek library, including fastners


	- Movement and morphing
		- Movement is extremely important in conveying the appearance of life,
		- Morphing is one of the main features, both interationwise, but also folding. 
			- It is an important feature, making Pepper special, making her a real (robot)girl.
			- Silence is important. Yes robots makes noises when moving, but only because it is difficult not to.
			- KISS. 5 dims. Looking up or down, changing hight, bending to the sides, twisting. 4d
				- explore LEGO or LocoKit, in combination with 3D printing. 
				- Contact Morten, søren kingo again, but also Koh.
		- Mobile platorm... takes a lot to be autonomous. Should not be included. 
			- NO MOBILE PLAFORM. counteracts the use as a living lamp.
				- Or maybe have something simple, but expand error detection. If unable to move because stuck, have sad mood. Cry for help. ["_"]
				- Should have a platform, in order to always turn to the sound. 

	- Light
		- Powerful RGB LED, possibly 220V bulb. 
		- Ambient Light sensor, to adjust. 
		- Hele kroppen lavet af led'er, kameleon funktion. 
			- Urealistisk. Ikke grundlæggende. 
		- 
	
	- Voice and sound
		- She reacts to tone of voice
		- she should moves to rythms, it is very natural. Use Som filter, low pass. Fourier Transform, no!.
			- Move.
		- Voice commands. Pepper, turn up light, turn down ligth. turn off light/go to sleep		
			- I will not use voice commands. Ok Google could be available. OK pepper
		- 2D sound, use for turning the right way when people speak loudly. Classify whether something is directed to Pepper, and when things are not. 			
		- NOT 3D sound, for interaction. 
			- Cannot track, without continuous sond. 
			- Will only react to sound from a certain proximity. stereoscoping. 
			- READ directional hearing article.
			- 

		- How should she react. Should she speak, or make sounds. Maybe only simulated with her movements. ... B&O
			- She is a lamp, she should be silent. 
				- Only movements should make sounds, making it a robot. 
				- ALmost silent though


	- Vision?
 		- Facial recognition and tracking..
		- Placer kamera, sådan at bevægelser påvirker cameraets fokus. 

	- Artificial life and mood
		- Like a cat, a living being.
		- meant for kids, should be bias for happiness.
			- Essentially a lamp. These are it's features.
		- At appropriate prximity, demand attension. 
			- Copy of kismet. like the moving architecht lamp.
		- 

	- Learning
		- Improving understanding of tone, unsupervised, or semi.
			- The purpose is me learning deep and kombinatorial learning.
			
		- She Must only react to thing that are actually directed at her.
			- train with her, think hundefløjte. Wireless clicker, so that things far away could also be trained.
				- If she reacts correctly, to stimuli
					- in which timeframe?? Maybe simply the last change of mood or posture. focus, i.e. looking a certain direction.
 			- 1: react correctly to tone of voice, change to correct mood, depending on current mood. 
			- 2: react only to things actually directed at her.
			- 3: react correctly to gestures, movements, maybe commands
			- 4: 

	- research or verification
		- experiment with how people react and accept the lamp, in a livingroom.

Essentially a living mood lamp. 




TALK TO KOH:
- Mechanics, how to get hight, roll pitch and yaw.
	- Work on design yourself.  
	- Use LocoKit. 
	- Not metal, 3D print, use Autodesk inventor to create design.
	- talk to Søren Kingo. 




KISS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Jeg arbejder ikke effektivt, hver lille opgave tager ugevis. Sådan er det bare. Ja det kan forbedres, men ikke bare sådan lige. Det kræver vedholdenhed. Motivation. Støtte.
